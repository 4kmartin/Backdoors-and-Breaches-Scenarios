Some Notes and  Scenarios written to play backdoors and breaches

# What is Backdoors and Breaches

Backdoors and breaches is a tabletop card game created by [Black Hills Information Security](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/tools/backdoorsandbreaches/). It is designed to simulate the Analysis, containment, and eradication phases of the [NIST incident response lifecycle](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf), with the initial prompt for the players typically (though not always) representing the discovery phase.

# Some house Rules

there are some procedure cards that do not (nominally) reveal a card, but should affect the game, because of this there are some house rules I have implemented consistently when I am leading a game.

## The crisis management card

As, I read it this card comes into play when an incident has been so effectively managed that the external fallout is neglegable. To simulte this, on a successful play of Crisis management I give the players 2 extra turns (only 2 so that they cannot chain them together to get infinite turns)

## the isolate card

Isolating affected machines can prevent spread of malware, and therby limit further disruption to buisiness. to simulate this; on a successful play of isolation, the players _can choose to_ block the next inject card.

## Incident Commander (DM) discression

this isn't really a house rule per-sae, but a note that is important for those playing this game while being unfamiliar with how this role works in other tabletop games. Essentially the role of the "incident commander" is to ensure the game is functional, yet enjoyable. Due to this, all tabletop games give their (DM equivilent role) the discression to make rulings on how something should work in a given session. even if this contradicts an established rule. For example, at your company, it may be plausible for an attack card to be revealed using a means not on the card. The incident commander can choose to consider that a means of detection as well.

# how are these scenarios developed?

These scenarios are all constructed on a random draw. I did not pick any of these atacks, nor did I modify them to "make them more realistic". Due to this some of these scenarios can get a little convoluted, but i try to create a narative that ties things together as reasonably as I can. The narative notes are just meant to be short notes to capture the ideas that tie things together.
